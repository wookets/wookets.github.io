      <description>The point of reeldata is to hit a live API, but then cache the result, so that you can work offline or even store the data locally and right tests against it. Once you write your tests against the data, you can rerun reeldata to pull down fresh data and rerun your tests to see if the data contract changed.
This obviously works best for read heavy APIs.

      <description>Overview The official docker website gives you a good overview. More simply, docker also you to image your application and infrastructure and deploy it rapidly and repeatedly. This is done by creating an isolated environment (a container) that can run side-by-side with other containers on the same hardware. Think of containers as Virtual Machines but without the resource hoginess / slowness.
Setup Downlaod Docker from the Docker Store. You&amp;rsquo;ll want to just grab the community edition.</description>

      <description> Disclaimer I had some help.
Overview React is a library for building user interfaces. Specifically the &amp;ldquo;view&amp;rdquo; portion of the MVC (model-view-controller) pattern. React is typically coupled with Redux or another Flux like pattern.
While many previous UI libraries did their best to separate presentation (html) from code (javascript), react actually goes all in on have javascript (and its own extension jsx) build the UI.

 blogimport blogger-to-hugo  blogimport first The readme&amp;rsquo;s for both don&amp;rsquo;t look too great, so flipping a coin, let&amp;rsquo;s go with blogimport. Apparently blogger-to-hugo also imports images, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have any of those.
It looks like we will have to clone down the repo and run the go file inside. Navigate to a clean directory.</description>

Overview Hugo is a static website generator. In my case, I was looking for a blog + some doc stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s always helpful to have an easy way to create pages. Sure, I looked at Jekyll, but Hugo turned out to be a bit easier. The reality is, it depends a bit on the theme you choose as well.

      <description>Here is a quick middleware error handler. It essentially follows the express document to a T. It should however be noted that exceptions in the code will not be caught by this, since they will break the whole server. For that, you need to use node domains, which are new in 0.8.x and should be in an upcoming post. Loading&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>About JSendJSend is a specification for how web servers should respond when they respond via JSON. I find it useful mainly for quickly parsing error and success response differences. &amp;nbsp;One could use HTTP error codes (I don&amp;rsquo;t know why), but JSend is useful for keeping the client receiver simple and generic when handling responses.&amp;nbsp;
JSend Success Example{status: &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo;, data: &amp;ldquo;this could be a json object&amp;rdquo;}
JSend Error Example{status: &amp;ldquo;error&amp;rdquo;, code: &amp;ldquo;InvalidParamter&amp;rdquo;, message: &amp;ldquo;Name is required.</description>

      <description>This took me about half a day to do&amp;hellip; Jackson&amp;rsquo;s documentation in certain places is a scattered shot of different ways based on version # and usually ending in half complete sentences or small specific pages that aren&amp;rsquo;t quite linked together in a relational sense. Jackson 2.0, I imagine, will further cludge the documentation due to refactors. But, by and large, it really is quite simple to write a deserializer or a serializer for that matter.</description>

      <description>Back when I first started programming, everything was about &amp;lsquo;The Three Tiers of server side applications.&amp;rsquo; Today, I find that not much has changed. Yes, the UI and top layers have been pushed to the client. If they haven&amp;rsquo;t in your apps, they should. And the bottom layer, the data layer as been almost stripped away via the ORM and Active Record patterns. Which is good, because we are getting to the guts, the middle layer, the business layer.</description>

      <description>One of the main reasons for using a language like Less is to move away from using &amp;lsquo;span10&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;col10&amp;rsquo; when using a grid based html layout for your webpage.
After all&amp;hellip;
&amp;lt;div class=&amp;ldquo;row&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;div class=&amp;ldquo;span10&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Main Content&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;div class=&amp;ldquo;span4&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Side Content&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem right&amp;hellip; But&amp;hellip;
&amp;lt;div class=&amp;ldquo;content&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;div class=&amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Main Content&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

Things of note&amp;hellip;
It should be less likely to crash your browser now given the absence of the previous crude attempt to simulate rain via javascript.&amp;nbsp;The design is based on (see &amp;lsquo;stolen&amp;rsquo;) from Twitter&amp;rsquo;s bootstrap project. Go check it out here.It is done using html5 and css3 with no care to support old insecure non-standard respecting browsers. &amp;nbsp;Content will come&amp;hellip; In time&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp;
PS - It is very likely&amp;hellip; Actually, it would be very surprising and somewhat in violation of the known laws of internet linking that every previously blogged demo and example is not broken.</description>

      <description>If you try groovy++, the results do bare out. And it will add static checking to your code inside of eclipse, which could be argued is more important than adding more servers.
However, it looks like groovy is adding first class support for the functionality in 2.0. Though it seems static checking will be in first and the performance improvements will happen later.

      <description>This is a poor man&amp;rsquo;s application profiler. Note, that this profiler is going to be limited, since it is running inside the application, but also nice that it is running inside the application. Anyway, I find it helpful to measure individual service calls against other service calls. One could even add a limit into this method, if it takes longer than x, send me an email because something is wrong&amp;hellip; Though, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure this code is not to great for production builds.</description>

      <description>In part 1, I showed you how to write a Controller and a Service which creates the AuthnRequest and sends a redirect.
I should mention that Controller is entirely derived from Spring&amp;rsquo;s MVC use of the word, but we in fact are not using it to handle or communicate with a view, just for the amazingly simple HTTP servlet like features.
Now, in part 2, we will add to the Controller and Service classes methods which make handling the incoming SAML Assertion HTTP POST cake.</description>

      <description>Overview
Recently I have had to do a small SAML 2.0 integration project for one of our clients to enable single sign on. Here are some thoughts on the issue.
Saml 2.0 is pretty easy
Much can be said about SOAP and insane and inane web service API&amp;rsquo;s, but SAML 2.0 is pretty straight forward. The basic flow can be summed;
System A -&amp;nbsp;Identity&amp;nbsp;holder
This system is the authority of authentication for our users.</description>

      <description>When you deploy your first elastic beanstalk application the URL will similar to&amp;hellip;
http://myapp-cname.elasticbeanstalk.com
Where &amp;lsquo;myapp-cname&amp;rsquo; is the assigned cname when you first launch your environment.&amp;nbsp;
What if we want to resolve our own domain, e.g.&amp;nbsp;
http://myapp.yourdomain.com
This is pretty straight forward (assuming some background in working with cnames)&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp;
CNAME
1. Go into the Amazon AWS console and locate the elastic load balancer. This is generally found under EC2 -&amp;gt; load balancers.</description>

      <title>Spring 3.1 Environment Profile</title>

      <description>The most useful addition to Spring 3.1 I&amp;rsquo;ve found is support for environments (called Profiles).
Here is the official post on this topic.
http://blog.springsource.com/2011/02/11/spring-framework-3-1-m1-released/
Profiles allow you to add / remove features / settings of your application based on the environment it is actually running in.
Example:
&amp;lt;beans profile=&amp;ldquo;beta&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;bean id=&amp;ldquo;appProperties&amp;rdquo; class=&amp;ldquo;wookets.bootstrap.AppProperties&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;property name=&amp;ldquo;someprop&amp;rdquo; value=&amp;ldquo;CHEESE&amp;rdquo;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/beans&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;beans profile=&amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;bean id=&amp;ldquo;appProperties&amp;rdquo; class=&amp;ldquo;wookets.bootstrap.AppProperties&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;property name=&amp;ldquo;someprop&amp;rdquo; value=&amp;ldquo;WAFFLES&amp;rdquo;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/beans&amp;gt;

If we are running the application on our beta server, we&amp;rsquo;ll get CHEESE.</description>

      <description>My blog keeps trying to ping my Amazon S3 account to serve content. FYI, my main page wookets.com is &amp;nbsp;hosted on Amazon S3 in a bucket. The bucket is web enabled with a policy file (see previous post). However, this blog is hosted on Google&amp;rsquo;s blogger.com.
My Hover DNS settings had three A-Records for my blog that resolved to google&amp;rsquo;s server, but checking out the latest Google blogger docs it seems like those A-Records are now defunct.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m attempting to use the invoker pattern with a spring controller. For instance&amp;hellip;
/app/invoke/hamburger/makeme
Navigating to this URL with either a GET or a POST should do the following&amp;hellip;
1. Look up and get a service called &amp;lsquo;HamburgerService&amp;rsquo; from the spring context.2. Invoke a method on our service bean called &amp;lsquo;makeme&amp;rsquo;3. If any params are passed in, pass them in as arguments to the makeme method.Example Groovy code:
HamburgerService.groovy

In your web.xml:

Spring attempts to run those requests through it&amp;rsquo;s own view resolvers, when you most likely want to have the default tomcat servlet handle it.</description>

Result:&amp;nbsp;http://wookets.com/code/adobe_muse/webarch/
Pretty crummy. The site that I put together that is&amp;hellip;
Muse is pretty limited on options, which makes it pretty straight forward to use, but I&amp;rsquo;m leery of making anything professional with such a tool. It does the same thing as dreamweaver and spits out code at the end and if you need a feature which the Muse tool doesn&amp;rsquo;t have&amp;hellip; Pretty much too bad, because changing generated code will never be fun.</description>

Jade -&amp;nbsp;https://github.com/visionmedia/jade
Stylus -&amp;nbsp;http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/
Each of these is a productivity enhancement. A language to express another language in a more terse manner. One of the main goals of each is DRY (don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself).
The big problem with these is&amp;hellip; How do I compile them in my environment with as little hassle as possible. Since, we are looking to become more, not less productive.</description>

I have recently been playing around with Apache Ivy and trying to get it to work. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at Maven. To be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t want / need a build system. Right click export is how I build and while that my seem crude to you, I really only release every two or so weeks.</description>

      <description>The barrier to entry for web development and systems configuration is so low that it is applicable to individuals with enough cognitive ability to process a work flow. That pool may be small, as many can&amp;rsquo;t correctly comprehend their own work flow or the ideal. However, software architects will be whittled down, forced to join the engineers and scientists in becoming ever more engrained in fluid repeatable generic design patterns not just for a monitor or a website, but for a machine of specific utility.</description>

      <description>Separate the client and the server
The server - responsible for complex shared business methods, transactions, data management, centralized storage, synchronization.
The client - responsible for UI display and handling interactions, styling, components, etc.
You should push as much as you can on to the client. Today&amp;rsquo;s javascript engines and multi-core processors can handle more computation. The client and server only talk using JSON, XML, REST, or AMF3 (if using flex) or similar methods.</description>

Btw, I should mention this is based on an architecture of fat client / thin server, but ability to shove off processing to one or the other. The server and client exchange information via JSON, XML, etc. The server does not render html.</description>

      <description>Finally, logging that makes some sense&amp;hellip;
In Groovy 1.8 they added a very nifty new way to do logging. But first, let&amp;rsquo;s revisit how we used to do logging.
&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; private static final Logger log = Logger.getLogger(CrudService.class);&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;if(log.isDebugEnabled()) {&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; String debugMsg = &amp;ldquo;INCOMING:: Create: &amp;ldquo; + resource.getClass() + &amp;ldquo;::&amp;rdquo; + resource.getId();&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; log.debug(debugMsg);&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;

Amazon SNS -&amp;nbsp;http://aws.amazon.com/sns/
Amazon SNS provides a Simple Notification Service for your apps. A line of thinking that maybe helpful would be viewing your app as sending a text message to the cloud. I use cloud as a generic term, because you are actually pushing your message to an unknown which will then re-route it to the system or services you wish to inform.</description>

http://swizframework.jira.com/wiki/display/SWIZ/Presentation+Model
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel
Now, what I&amp;rsquo;ve done is taken this design model and made a tag for Swiz flex applications.
http://swizframework.org/
Reasons:
1. I was sick of declaring prototype beans.
2. [Model] is more clear than [Inject]&amp;hellip; In terms of making sure people are following the pattern.
3. I did not like (but the tag does support) the idea of changing a UI state in the Model code.</description>

      <description>The org.springframework.web.servlet.view.ContentNegotiatingViewResolver let&#39;s you map a response from your controller and have it auto formatted without a nary of hint in the actual code. However, exception handling of the controller does not seem to follow this&amp;nbsp;ideology. Maybe this will be fixed in a future version (I hope) or is already fixed in a newer version (don&#39;t feel like upgrading libs atm). For context, I&#39;m using Spring 3.0.5-Release.&amp;nbsp;Here is how my exception handler should look and act.</description>

      <description>Useful if you just got a new mac with Lion installed and need to get subclipse up and running. Collabnet hasn&amp;rsquo;t updated the SVN binaries to 10.7 yet. So a work around.
&amp;ldquo;Open this file : sudo pico /System/Library/Core Services/SystemVersi on.plist change version to 10.6 wherever you see 10.7 install subversion change back to 10.7&amp;rdquo; (as taken from below)

http://wookets.com/code/flex/NaviDemo/FlexNaviDemo.html
A very simple navigation demo.
The crux is&amp;hellip; Define your views at the root of the application. Then use a contextual class to update the root view a generic &amp;lsquo;goto&amp;rsquo; function. This is done view the static Navi class, but could certainly be done using IoC or a Singleton type pattern. FYI, this is using states, but one could also use a viewstack (there is a flex 4 version somewhere around here)&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Pros:
- Streaming
- UI / Searching is extremely fast
- Can sync own music files
Cons:
- No &amp;lsquo;genius&amp;rsquo; mode custom playlists&amp;hellip; Can&amp;rsquo;t they make it so based on a song it loads a variety of music to create a playlist with new artists that I can find?
- The UI is cumbersome. A better album view would be nice. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re searching their online database, everything revolves around playlists.</description>

      <description>On my way to hockey this morning (6:45am), Sufjan Stevens (hopefully I just butchered his name) was playing on the current. It just happened to be the song that was stuck in my head, since they played it on the radio the day before (at least the female backing harmony chorus part was stuck in my head). Btw, the song is from Age of Adz, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t the foggiest about the name.</description>

      <description>Exception:
null id in entry (don&amp;rsquo;t flush the Session after an exception occurs)
I was getting the above exception in spring hibernate junit jpa type test when trying to persist an entity. You actually get the exception after the entity is &amp;lsquo;persisted&amp;rsquo;. The error is thrown because of a validation type error with the database table (property not set when DB needs it to be set or something), but hibernate keeps chugging along and holds the object in session in a weird quasi not-persistent, but still in session state.</description>

Your mileage may vary on andriod, but I assume it will work just fine. This only works because webkit has viewers for these file formats. No editing, just viewing.

      <description>Wow. Covering the full gamut today. From Flex-Swiz-Event Order to Javascript-jQuery-Image Scaling to Java-Spring-Xml&amp;nbsp;Marshalling.
The problem I faced was this (http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?t=79963). Essentially, Spring MVC / XStream sometimes maps a returned object (see below) to an&amp;nbsp;incoherent&amp;nbsp;string of framework object binding instructions.
The Spring MVC Service
@Controller public class SessionService { @Autowired private ServerSessionContext serverSessionContext; @RequestMapping(value = &amp;ldquo;/validatesession&amp;rdquo;) public SessionValidationResponse validateSessionToken(@RequestParam String sessionToken) { SessionValidationResponse response = new SessionValidationResponse(); response.isValid = serverSessionContext.doesSessionExist(sessionToken); return response; } }</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m trying to figure out why Swiz is actually firing events in the exact opposite order that it says in the documentation. The application startup [PostConstruct] is fired after creationComplete, but the [PostConstruct] of views and objects is happening before creationComplete. Not sure why it&amp;rsquo;s working like this. It was working fine before. Or so I thought.
Anyway&amp;hellip; A good reason to never trust the firing order of events in flex.</description>

The gist is; I want to write the interface between my client (javascript / flex / another client) and my services (java / php / whatever you want) and be able to swap out any of these things, but not have to recode the other end. And do it using simple web protocols, not AMF where a client library or something &amp;lsquo;more&amp;rsquo; is needed.</description>

ErrorDocument 403 /403.shtmlErrorDocument 404 /404.shtmlErrorDocument 500 /500.shtml

navigateToUrl - Will open a page with the url specified.
sendToUrl - Will send a request behind the scenes, but won&amp;rsquo;t tell you what the response was&amp;hellip;
URLLoader - Will allow you listen for a response or know when the request you just sent has been completed (acknowledged).&amp;nbsp;

      <description>I once worked at a company which had a class that was 10,000 or so lines of code. This class was a &amp;lsquo;model&amp;rsquo; in which seemingly every function under the sun was imbedded into the object. Not only did it store referenced get and set variables, was mapped to a database table, had util functions, and database queries as well. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, but a class with 10,000 lines of code from an application being worked on for only a few years is insane.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m making my soccer team run the beep test this Saturday, so I decided to code up an iPad app to help.&amp;nbsp;
The app is written using a flex 4.5 hero build. I have&amp;nbsp;already tested it on my iPad 2 using the Air 2.6 ADT packager. Besides a hiccup when playing the very first beep, it runs silky smooth and feels stable.&amp;nbsp;

App dimensions are... width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;768&#34; (iPad dimensions)</description>

      <title>Flex - Load apps within an app</title>

It should be noted that setting or trying to bind the source on the SWFLoader doesn&amp;rsquo;t work properly. As you change states within the parent app, you need to load and unload the whole app. This is best for memory management, but if you want to cache the app&amp;hellip; well, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work for me between states unless I load and unload the whole thing.</description>

      <title>Code - Adding Behaviors to Flex Components</title>

      <description>It is tempting to write your own flex components that extend the base components (TextInput, Button, etc), because you want to add some functionality or just add your own zip. Having undertaken such a task many times, I can say that things become a mess. Upgrading to a new SDK breaks things, tempts you to update components to the new SDK, breaking more things, etc. Another problem is that once you make your own super awesome button override, you want to use it everywhere, even though a lot of places won&amp;rsquo;t use the new functionality you enabled.</description>

      <description>Somewhere between yesterday and today, I came across OrientDB.
http://code.google.com/p/orient/
They (being the creators) make some bold claims.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;ldquo;A single server makes the work of about 125 servers running&amp;nbsp;MySQL&amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;can store up to 150,000 records per second on common hardware&amp;rdquo;
Features:&amp;nbsp;
REST, Java APIs&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp;
Document, Object, SQL, Key-Value + other db form supports&amp;hellip; Basically a document storage and uses a grid store for the relationships. Everything (SQL, Key-Value, Object, etc) is built on top of those two things.</description>

      <description>There are many various data storage devices (talking software here) that accommodate various problems. All of these devices are very good at the specific (or few) use cases that they solve, but all have drawbacks. 
SQL Databases - Structure data that can be queried. Also includes rigid data integrity and relationship constraints were added (foreign keys, etc). Added views to speed up and avoid joins. The main drawbacks, unless you buy an Oracle and an Engineer to go with it, optimization and clustering / fault tolerance can be trying.</description>

      <title>Spring Hibernate Open Session In View Filter</title>

      <description>Hibernate allows use to efficiently query relationships from a database via lazy-loading. However, relationships which are lazily-loaded can not be accessed if the hibernate session goes out of view.
 #{Album.artist.name}

Because of lazy loading, if you try to do the preceding relationship access in your EL (web page) statement, a lazy load error will be thrown. This is because if you are using JSF or some other non spring friendly web layer, and your session will cut out in the service layer.</description>
